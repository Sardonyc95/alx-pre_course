## 011. Preserving your mental health & Conquering imposter syndrome
### Learning Objectives:
As you dive into this program, you are likely to have different kinds of days. These could be easy days where everything makes sense, hard days where you feel you like crushing your computer because for some reason you don’t understand why your code is working. Other days you just want to quit because it feels you can’t push through the program.

Irrespective of the days you have, always remember your mental health is key and important, just by getting started, you can do it and even when you think you can’t continue and you feel your peers are ahead of you, look at your journey and own.
