### 004. Introduction to mindsets (Grit and growth mindsets)
- Task 0. Growth Mindset and Grit

One great way you can support your peers in this program is by reminding them to practice a growth mindset. It takes time to develop a growth mindset, and this assignment gives you a great opportunity to practice it.
> Preparation
For this task, you will find 1 person on your cohort who is available to have 30-minute call. You can find someone in your cohort channel on Slack. You could use an online word processor such as Google Docs.
> Step 1
Schedule a time for the 30-minute call for as soon as possible. You can arrange to meet virtually with whatever tool you wish. Video calling is integrated into Slack
> Step 2
Once you are on the call, discuss each of the following questions together, making sure you both understand the answers:
1. What is growth mindset? What is fixed mindset?
2. What evidence is there that growth mindset is important? (Describe at least one study: what group was studied, what was the treatment, and what was the result?)
3. What is the most common misunderstanding about growth mindset?
4. Why is the word “yet” so powerful for growth mindset? Each of you should give your own example of how you can use “yet.”
5. Is intelligence fixed? Explain.
6. What is grit?
7. Give an example of grit from your own life.
8. What evidence is there that grit is important? (Describe at least one study: what group was studied, what was the treatment, and what was the result?)
> Next, you should take turns EACH answering the following reflection questions
1. What do you understand about mindset now that you did not understand before?
2. What do you think is more important: effort or intelligence? Explain your opinion.
3. How motivated do you personally feel to develop greater growth mindset? Be honest.
4. Describe a time when you failed at something. What feelings did you have at the time? When you look back on that time how do you feel now? What did the failure teach you?
5. Give at least 2 of your own personal “yet” sentences. (For example, “I am not employed as a software engineer yet.”
6. What is one way you can practice growth mindset?
Thank your partner for having this conversation with you!
> Step 3
Create a short write-up that includes the following (this is what you will submit to get credit for the assignment):
A. Your partner’s name
B. Date and time of the conversation
C. Were there any areas of confusion or disagreement in your conversation?
D. What is one thing you learned or better understand as a result of the conversation?
E. Give your own personal “yet” sentence.
F. What is one way you personally plan to practice growth mindset?
> Step 4
paste a link to your google doc or a pdf in your google drive below.
The milestone is NOT complete until you have completed this step.
You are also encouraged to post your answers to C, D, E, & F to your country channels on Slack, but this is optional.

Speak each question aloud to your interviewee. Feel free to slightly modify the language to make it sound like you, but please make sure you ask all of these questions.
- Thank you for sharing your time with me today. This should take 30 minutes or less of your time. I’m learning more about success and failure and am hoping you’d be willing to share honestly with me about your own experiences with each. I will not be sharing your full name nor specific story with others, and it would help me if you could be as honest as possible.
- Can you share a brief story about a time you were successful in your life? Usually the first story that pops to mind is the best one. How did you feel when you succeeded? What do you think helped you achieve this success?
- Thank you. Can you describe a time in your life where you failed at something that was important to you? Usually the first story that pops to mind is the best one. How did you feel when you failed? What do you think contributed to this failure?

### 009. Owning your Learning

### 010.Your network is your net worth
- Task 0. Create your LinkedIn account if needed and populate your Intranet profile!

If you don’t have one already, create your LinkedIn account.
When done or if you already have one, update your Intranet profile page, section “Social presence”, LinkedIn URL.
The LinkedIn URL should look like this: https://www.linkedin.com/in/<name>

- Task 1. Create a professional LinkedIn profile

To have a professional-looking LinkedIn profile, here are some important things to do:
- Use a professional profile photo: Your profile photo is the first thing people see when they visit your LinkedIn profile. Make sure it’s a professional headshot that reflects your industry and personal brand. If you do not have a professional headshot (like most of us), simply put a picture of yourself. Here is an article with examples and advice
- Craft a compelling headline: Your headline should be a brief summary of your professional experience, skills, and expertise. It should make people want to learn more about you. You are allowed to use ChatGPT for this.
- Write a summary that showcases your strengths: Your summary should highlight your professional strengths, experience, and career goals. It should be well-written and engaging, and it should make people want to connect with you. You are allowed to use ChatGPT for this.
- Customize your LinkedIn URL: Customizing your LinkedIn URL can make it easier for people to find you and remember your profile. It also looks more professional than the default URL.
- List your work experience and education: Make sure your work experience and education are up-to-date and complete. Be sure to include any relevant certifications, awards, or achievements.
- Use keywords: Use keywords throughout your profile to help people find you when they search for specific skills or expertise.
- Ask for recommendations: Recommendations from colleagues and supervisors can help to validate your skills and experience. Be sure to ask for recommendations from people who know your work well.
Overall, a professional-looking LinkedIn profile should be well-written, complete, and engaging. It should showcase your strengths and expertise and make people want to connect with you.

- Task 2. Connect with 10 persons

Connect with 10 new persons (you can do more if you would like of course). It could be:
- your friends
- someone from the ALX SE staff
- your peers
- someone from your family
When you ask someone to connect with you, make sure you add a personalized message. For instance, if you would like to connect with Julien Barbier, make sure to mention that you are one of his students from ALX SE. If you would like to connect with your ALX peers, make sure to mention you are going through ALX. etc.
From this day on, anytime you meet someone (online, email, offline, etc.) get into the habit of connecting with them on LinedIn. Remember ALX SE permits you to meet with so many incredible people. Take advantage of this. You should have at least hundreds of connections at the end of the program just by adding peers you interact with.

- Task 3. Follow 5 influencers

You can also follow people on LinkedIn without connecting to them. It could be people or even brands. If you don’t know where to start, you can follow Faces of ALX SE

You pushed your first file in your first repository of the first task of your first ALX School project.
You can now check your repository on GitHub to see if everything is good.

- Task 1. Rep0-session

Create a new directory called 0x03-git in your alx-zero_day repo.
Make sure you include a not empty README.md in your directory:
- at the root of your repository alx-zero_day
- AND in the directory 0x03-git
And important part: Make sure your commit and push your code to Github - otherwise the Checker will always fail.

- Task 2. Coding fury road

For the moment we have an empty project directory containing only a README.md. It’s time to code!
- Create these directories at the root of your project: bash, c, js
- Create these empty files:
-- c/c_is_fun.c
-- js/main.js
-- js/index.js
- Create a file bash/alx with these two lines inside: #!/bin/bash and echo "ALX"
- Create a file bash/school with these two lines inside: #!/bin/bash and echo "School"
- Add all these new files to git
- Commit your changes (message: “Starting to code today, so cool”) and push to the remote server

- Task 3. Collaboration is the base of a company

A branch is like a copy of your project. It’s used mainly for:
- adding a feature in development
- collaborating on the same project with other developers
- not breaking your entire repository
- not upsetting your co-workers
The purpose of a branch is to isolate your work from the main code base of your project and/or from your co-workers’ work.
For this project, create a branch update_script and in this branch:
- Create an empty file named bash/98
- Update bash/alx by replacing echo "ALX" with echo "ALX School"
- Update bash/school by replacing echo "School" with echo "The school is open!"
- Add and commit these changes (message: “My personal work”)
- Push this new branch Tips
Perfect! You did an amazing update in your project and it’s isolated correctly from the main branch.
Ho wait, your manager needs a quick fix in your project and it needs to be deployed now:
- Change branch to main
- Update the file bash/alx by replacing echo "ALX" with echo "ALX School is so cool!"
- Delete the directory js
- Commit your changes (message: “Hot fix”) and push to the origin
Ouf, hot fix is done!

- Task 4. Collaboration: be up to date

Of course, you can also work on the same branch as your co-workers and it’s best if you keep up to date with their changes.
For this task – and only for this task – please update your file README.md in the main branch from GitHub.com. It’s the only time you are allowed to update and commit from GitHub interface.
After you have done that, in your terminal:
- Get all changes of the main branch locally (i.e. your README.md file will be updated)
- Create a new file up_to_date at the root of your directory and in it, write the git command line used
- Add up_to_date to git, commit (message: “How to be up to date in git”), and push to the origin

- Task 5. HAAA what did you do???

Collaboration is cool, but not really when you update the same file at the same time…
To illustrate that, please merge the branch update_script to main: “Cool, all my changes will be now part of the main branch, ready to be deployed!”
HHHHHHHAAAAAAAA

> CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in bash/alx

As you can see, you have conflicts between two branches on the same file.
Your goal now is to resolve conflicts by using the version of the branch update_script, and push the result to the origin.
At the end, you should have all your work from the branch update_script (new file and two updated files) and all latest main commits (new files, delete folder, etc.), without conflicts.
